Hi,

My name is Saisiddarth Domala, and the following is my term project for 15-112. It is a tower defense game called "Animal Survival."

The goal of my game is to protect three sources of survival (grass, fruits, and a barn) from monsters, zombies, and ghosts. 

Users strategically place animals on a grid, and these animals launch weapons to defeat these enemies.


The main file is called "CreateGame.py". That's where a majority of the logic/animation takes place. In order to run my project, a user
should run this specific file on a Python IDE.  




To install pygame, a necessary module for my program, please follow the module manager prompts. This code is borrowed from 
the 15-112 website. You can find the link here:

There are no shortcut commands.
